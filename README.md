### Name
The nebula’s number in J. L. E. Dreyer’s New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (NGC) or Index Cata-logue (IC). When not so numbered, the designation is that of one of the following authors: Cederblad (Ced); Gum; Minkowski (M1); Rodgers, Campbell, and Whiteoak (RCW); Sharpless (Sh2); van den Bergh (vdB); van den Bergh and Herbst (vdBH).

### α 2000 and δ 2000
Right ascension and declination, referred to the 2000.0 equinox.

### Const 
Constellation in which the nebula is located, according to the coordinates given. Some nebulae may span more than one constellation.

### Type
Nebula type, either emission (E), reflection (R), or a combination of the two (E+R).

### Dim
Approximate maximum and minimum angular dimensions, in minutes of arc.

### Description 
Five observational characteristics of the nebula arelisted, as follows:

1. *Visibility*, as given in the NGC or IC: extremely faint (eeF or
eF), very faint (vF), faint (F), pretty faint (pF), pretty bright (pB), bright (B), very bright (vB), or extremely bright (eB). These descriptions, supplied by many different 19th-century observers using a wide variety of telescopes, are not homogeneous but may serve as a rough guide. It is important to note that the description for an NGC object is always the viswa/ impression through a telescope (of perhaps 6- to 30-inch aperture), while for an IC object it is often based on the photographic appearance.

2. *Brightness* of the nebula on red-sensitive photographic plates. The scale ranges from 1 (brightest) to 6 (faintest), as in B. T. Lynds’s 1965 catalogue.

3. *Color* based on the nebula’s appearance on red- and blue-sen- sitive photographic plates. The color may be called very red (VR), red (R), moderately red (MR), intermediate (I), moderately blue (MB), blue (B) or very blue (VB). Intermediate means equally con- spicuous on red and blue plates. Sometimes a range of color is not- ed, as for the Trifid nebula.

4. *Shape*, whether irregular (Ir), elliptical (E), or circular (C).

5. *Structure*, either amorphous (A), filamentary (F), or a combi-
nation of the two (AF).

### HD 
Henry Draper number, or other designation, of the star il- luminating the nebula. Where appropriate, the variable star name may be listed instead. When a cluster is responsible for the nebular excitation, the NGC, IC, Collinder (Cr), or Stock (St) designation is given.

### *Mag 
Illuminating star’s photoelectric visual V magnitude, if listed to two decimal places, or its visual magnitude, if listed to one. The letter ‘‘v’’ indicates that the brightness of the star varies.

### *Spec 
Spectral type of the illuminating star.

### Notes
Common names, Messier numbers, and other information are listed here. Many words are abbreviated: association (assoc.), Barnard dark nebula (B), cluster (cl.), following or east of (f), Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), nebula (neb.), north (n), preceding or west of (p), reflection (refl.), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), south (s), supernova remnant (SNR), Trumpler open cluster (Tr). If the illuminating star has a common name or a variable star designation not listed earlier, it appears here within brackets.
